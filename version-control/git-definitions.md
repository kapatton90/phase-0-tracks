# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Version control is what allows you to view any changes made to a file or multiple files. It is what enables you to see the history of all different versions of that file.
* Why is it useful? It is useful because this allows you to see the changes made at different points and by whom they were made. You can decide which changes to keep, which ones to discard and even roll back to a previous version if a mistake was made.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is a copy of the main file that you can work on without changing the master copy. This is very useful when multiple people are working on the same file, because you can see what they have added or changed on their branch and decide whether or not to merge it with the master file.
* What is a commit? A commit is a save point for any changes you have made it git. You can return to a commit if you decide you want to go back to a previous version of your file before certain changes were made.
* What makes a good commit message? A good commit message is specific. It details what was changed between this commit and the previous one.
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict occurs when something is keeping two branchs from merging. This is usually caused by different people trying to merge information on the same line of a file.
