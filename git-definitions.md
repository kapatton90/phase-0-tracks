+# Git Definitions
 +
 +**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.
 +
 +* What is version control? Version control allows you to view the history of reviosions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by different people. 

 +* Why is it useful? This is useful when working with multiple people or even by yourself, because it tracks all of the changes made to a repository and you can go back to a previous point that was saved in the history of the repository. 

 +* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch gives you a copy of your project to work on without changing the main portion of the project. For instance, you could have a main document that gathers information from different people and pulls that information in on separate branchs. That way you can decide what information to add to your main branch and what to keep separate.

 +* What is a commit? A commit is a point at which you save the changed information in a repository. This is also a point you can return to, if you decide that you want to go back to an earlier version of your repository. 

 +* What makes a good commit message? A good commit message details what you have changed since the last commit.

 +* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when you have you try to change information on the same file on the same line. It confuses git on which piece of information to use until you resolve the conflict.
